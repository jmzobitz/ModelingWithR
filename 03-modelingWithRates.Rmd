# Modeling with rates of change
So far we have looked at some examples for how we can apply rates of change to develop a mathematical model, and also learned a little bit about the ways we can apply computational software such as `R`.

In this section we are going to look some additional examples of how we can translate equations with rates of change to understand phenomena.  

## Lynx and Hares
Our first example is a *system of differential equations*.  The context is between the snowshoe hare and the Canadian lynx. Here is a picture of them below from [link](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/canseq150-genome-sequencing-lynx-hare-1.4676308) 

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width = "5in"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/03-systems/lynx-hare.png")
```

This has been a well studied system (REFERENCES), and a timeseries of their population is shown with this figure from REFERENCE.


```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width = "5in"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/03-systems/lynx-hare-timeseries.png")
```

Notice how in this figure both populations seem to fluctuate periodically.  One plausible reason is that the lynx prey on the snowshoe hares, which causes the population to initially decline.  Once the snowshoe hare population declines, then there is less food for the lynx to survive, so their population declines.  The decline in the lynx population causes the hare population to increase, and so on it goes ...


In summary it is safe to say that the two populations are *coupled* to one another.  But in order to understand how they are coupled together, first let's consider the two populations *separately*.


The hares grow much more quickly than then lynx - in fact some hares have been known to reproduce several times a year, so a reasonable assumption (assuming the hare population is much larger) is that rate of change of the hares is proportional to the hare population.  Based on this assumption we have the following differential equation, with $H$ is the population of the hares:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dH}{dt} = r H
\end{equation}

In this case we know that the growth rate $r$ is positive, so then the rate of change ($H'$) will be positive as well, and $H$ will be increasing. Typical values given for $r$ in REFERENCE are between 1.8 - 2.0 year$^{-1}$.  One way to think about $b$ is - to take its inverse (about 0.5 - 0.55 years), which represents the amount of time that passes before the hare population decreases by one (pretty short!)

Let's consider the lynx now.  A approach is to assume their population declines exponentially, or changes at the rate proportional to the current population.  Let's consider $L$ to be the lynx population, so we have the following equation for them:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dL}{dt} = -dL
\end{equation}

As you can see in this case, the death rate $d$ is positive, leading to a negative rate of change for the Lynx population (and a decreasing value for $L$).  Typical values of $d$ are 0.9 - 2.4 year$^{-1}$.  One way to think about $d$ is - like $b$ - to take its inverse (about 0.4 - 1.1 years), which represents the amount of time that passes before the lynx population decreases by one.

The next part to consider is how they interact.  Since the hares are prey for the lynx, when the lynx hunt, the hare population.  We can represent this with the following adjustment to our hare equation:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dH}{dt} = r H - b HL
\end{equation}

So the parameter $b$ represents the hunting rate.  Notice how we have the term $HL$ for this interaction.  This term injects a sense of realism: if the lynx are not present ($L=0$), then the hare population can't decrease due to hunting.  We say that the *interaction* between the hares and the lynx with multiplication.  Typical values for $b$ are 480 - 870 hares $\cdot$ lynx$^{-1}$ year$^{-1}$.  It is okay if that unit seems a little odd to you - it should be!  Here is one way to think about it.  The quantity $\displaystyle \frac{dH}{dt}$ represents the *rate of change* of the hares, so it should have units of hares per year.  Since the term $bHL$ has both lynx and hare, the units for $b$ need to account for this.

How does hunting affect the lynx population?  One possibility is that it increases the lynx population:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dL}{dt} =bHL -dL
\end{equation}

Notice the symmetry between the rate of change for the hares and the lynx equations.  In many cases this makes sense - if you subtract a rate from one population, then that rate should be added to the receiving population.  You could also argue that there is some efficiency loss in converting the hares to lynx - not all of the hare is converted int the lynx biomass.  In this situation we sometimes like to adjust the lynx equation with another parameter $e$, representing the efficiency that hares are converted into lynx:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dL}{dt} =e\cdot bHL -dL
\end{equation}

(sometimes people just make a new parameter $c=e \cdot b$, but for now we will just leave it as is).  So now we have the following coupled system of differential equations:

\begin{align}
\frac{dH}{dt} &= r H - b HL \\
\frac{dL}{dt} &=ebHL -dL
\end{align}


The schematic diagram representing these interactions is the following:

```{r lynxhare,engine='tikz',warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
\begin{center}

\tikzstyle{vspecies}=[rectangle,minimum size=0.5cm,draw=black]
\begin{tikzpicture}[auto, outer sep=1pt, node distance=2cm]

\node [vspecies] (H) {$H$} ;
\node [vspecies, right of = H] (L) {$L$} ;
\draw [->] ([yshift=3pt]H.east) --  node[above] {\small{$b$}} ([yshift=3pt]L.west) ;
\draw [->] ([yshift=-3pt]L.west) --  node[below] {\small{$eb$}} ([yshift=-3pt]H.east) ;
\draw [->] (L.east) --  node[above] {\small{$d$}} +(1cm,0pt) ;
\draw [<-] (H.west) --  node[above] {\small{$r$}} +(-1cm,0pt) ;

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
```



 This differential equation is a classical model in mathematical biology and differential equations - it is called the *predator prey* model, also known as the [Lotka-Volterra equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equations).  There is a lot of interesting mathematics from this system of equations that we will study later in this textbook.  The next steps of the analysis that we will be working on is determining solutions to these differential equations numerically or directly.

Stenseth paper - this is a lot more complicated than we think!

## The Law of Mass Action
Notice in the previous section that the interaction between the lynx and the hare was of the form *bHL* - meaning you needed both positive values of *H* and *L* for the interaction to continue.  This law states that the rate of a change is directly proportional to the *product* of the populations.

This assumption of the law of mass action is also commonly used in chemical reactions - especially in modeling enzyme dynamics.  For example let's say you have a substrate *A* that reactions with enzyme *B* to form a product *S*.  Perhaps you might have seen this represented as a reaction equation:

\begin{equation}
A+B \rightarrow S
\end{equation}

How we would write the product of formation, or $\displaystyle \frac{dS}{dt}$ is the following:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dS}{dt}= kAB,
\end{equation}

where $k$ is the proportionality constant or the rate constant associated with the reaction.  If we wanted to represent this as a schematic we would have the following diagram:

```{r,engine='tikz',warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
\begin{center}

\tikzstyle{vspecies}=[rectangle,minimum size=0.5cm,draw=black]
\begin{tikzpicture}[auto, outer sep=1pt, node distance=2cm]

\node [vspecies] (A) {$A$} ;
\node [vspecies, right of = A] (S) {$S$} ;
\draw [->] ([yshift=0pt]A.east) --  node[above] {\small{$kB$}} ([yshift=0pt]S.west) ;
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

```

We could also consider if there was a constant decay of the substrate, which we might revise our diagram to the following:

```{r,engine='tikz',warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
\begin{center}

\tikzstyle{vspecies}=[rectangle,minimum size=0.5cm,draw=black]
\begin{tikzpicture}[auto, outer sep=1pt, node distance=2cm]

\node [vspecies] (A) {$A$} ;
\node [vspecies, right of = A] (S) {$S$} ;
\draw [->] ([yshift=0pt]A.east) --  node[above] {\small{$kB$}} ([yshift=0pt]S.west) ;
\draw [->] (S.east) --  node[above] {\small{$d$}} +(1cm,0pt) ;
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

```

## Invasive species
Let's look at another example where we will determine a differential equation model from a context:


> An invasive species enters new territory at a rate proportional to the difference between the current number of native individuals and the number of invasive individuals established in the territory. Assume that the number of native individuals is constant.
<!-- LW pg 5 -->


For this problem we will start by naming our variables.  Let $I$ represent number of invasive individuals and $N$ the number of native individuals.  We will break this down accordingly:

- *An invasive species enters new territory at a rate proportional* means $\displaystyle \frac{dI}{dt}$.
- *proportional to the difference between the current number of native individuals and the number of invasive individuals established in the territory* means $\displaystyle k \cdot (N-I)$, where $k$ is the proportionality constant.  Including this parameter helps to avoid assuming we have a 1:1 correspondence between the growth rate of the invasive individuals and the population difference.
- *Assume that the number of native individuals is constant.* This means that $N=C$, or equivalently $\displaystyle \frac{dN}{dt} = 0$  (a constant function has zero rate of change).

So in summary we have the following model:
\begin{equation}
\frac{dI}{dt} = k(N-I)
\end{equation}

Does this equation seem familiar to you?  It is similar to the second model in Chapter 1 for the spread of Ebola!  While this may seem surprising, it is often the case that similar equations appear in different contexts.  It is far more advantageous to learn how to analyze models qualitatively rather than memorize several different types of models and not see the connections between them.



<!-- LW pg 73 has some good examples, derived in handlingh patches. -->
## Other types of functional responses 
In several examples we have seen a rate of change proportional to the current population, as in the rate of growth of the hare population is $rH$.  This is one example of what we would call a [*functional response*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_response).  Another type of functional response assumes that the rate reaches a limiting value proportional to the population size, so $\displaystyle \frac{dH}{dt} = \frac{rH}{1+arH}$. This is an example of a **type II functional response**.  Finally the type II response has also been generalized (a **type III functional response**) $\displaystyle \frac{dH}{dt} = \frac{rH^{2}}{1+arH^{2}}$. The following plot shows all three together:

```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.width=5,fig.height=4}
x <- seq(0,2,by=.01)

  
type1 <-  .5*x
type2 <- 2*x/(1+2*x)
type3 <- 4*x^2/(1+4*x^2)

my_data <- data.frame(x,type1,type2,type3) %>%
  gather(key=type,value=value,-x)
ggplot() +
  geom_line(data=my_data,aes(x=x,y=value,color=type),size=1.0) +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(size=20),
          axis.title.x=element_text(size=20),
          axis.text.x=element_text(size=15),
          axis.text.y=element_text(size=15),
          axis.title.y=element_text(size=20),
          legend.position = 'bottom') +
    labs(x='x',y = 'Rate') +
  scale_color_discrete(name="Functional \n Response",
                      labels=c("Type I", "Type II","Type III"))



```

Notice the limiting behavior in the Type II and Type III functional responses.  These responses are commonly used in ecology and predator-prey dynamics and in problems of how animals search for food.

## Exercises
```{exercise}
Consider the following type of functional responses:
\begin{align}
\mbox{ Type I: } \frac{dP}{dt} &= a P \\
\mbox{ Type II: } \frac{dP}{dt} &= \frac{aP}{1+abP} \\
\mbox{ Type III: } \frac{dP}{dt} &= \frac{rP^{2}}{1+arP^{2}}
\end{align} 
  
For each of the functional responses evaluate $\displaystyle \lim_{P \rightarrow \infty} \frac{dP}{dt}$.  Since these functional responses represent a rate of change of a population, what are some examples (hypothetical or actual) would each of these responses be appropriate?


```
&nbsp;
```{exercise}
A population grows according to the equation $\displaystyle \frac{dP}{dt} = \frac{aP}{1+abP} - dP$, where $a$, $b$ and $d$ are parameters.  Determine the value of $P$ when the population is in steady state, that is $\displaystyle \frac{dP}{dt}=0$.
```
&nbsp;
```{exercise}
For a chemical reaction takes two chemicals $X$ and $Y$ to form a substrate $Z$ through the law of mass action.  However the substrate can also disassociate.  The reaction schematic is the following:
  
\begin{equation}
X + Y \rightleftharpoons Z,
\end{equation}

where the proportionality constant $k_+$ is associated with the formation of the substrate $Z$ and $k_-$ the disassociation ($Z$ decays back to $X$ and $Y$). Write down a differential equation that represents the rate of reaction $\displaystyle \frac{dZ}{dt}$.

```

For each of the following exercises consider the following contextual situations modeling rates of change.  Name variables for each situation and write down a differential equation describing the context. For each problem you will need to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Name and describe all variables.
\item Write down a differential equation.
\item Identify and describe any parameters needed.
\item Write a brief one-two sentence explanation of why your differential equation models the situation at hand.
\item Hand sketch a rough graph of what you think the solution as a function of time - \emph{note:} your solution needs to be consistent with your explanation and vice versa.
\end{itemize}

<!-- From Burnham and Anderson pg 135 of pdf -->
```{exercise}
You are tasked with the job of investigating the effect of a pesticide on water quality, in terms of its effects on the health of the plants and fish in the ecosystem.  Different models can be created that investigate the effect of the pesticide.  Different types of reaction schemes for this system are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:pesticide-ch3), where $F$ represents the amount of pesticide in the fish, $W$ the amount of pesticide in the water, and $S$ the amount of pesticide in the soil.  The prime (e.g. $F'$, $W'$, and $S'$ represent other bound forms of the respective state).  In all seven different models can be derived. For each of the model schematics, apply the Law of Mass Action to write down a system of differential equations.
