# Modeling With Rates of Change {#modeling-rates-03}
So far we have looked at some examples for how we can apply rates of change to develop a mathematical model, and also learned a little bit about the ways we can apply computational software such as `R`. In this section we are going to look some additional examples of how we can translate equations with rates of change to understand phenomena.  The focus here will be on writing differential equations from a contextual description.

Oftentimes when we construct differential equations from a contextual description we bring our own understanding and knowledge to this situation.  How _you_ may write down the differential equation may be different from someone else - _do not worry!_  This is the fun part of modeling: models can be considered testable hypotheses that can be refined when confronted with data. In this section I work through a few well-known examples from mathematical biology and you will apply that knowledge to develop models from context.

## Lynx and Hares
Our first example is a *system of differential equations*.  The context is between the snowshoe hare and the Canadian lynx. Figure \@ref(fig:lynx-hare) shows a picture of them below from [link](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/canseq150-genome-sequencing-lynx-hare-1.4676308) 

```{r lynx-hare, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "The lynx and hare - aren't they beautiful?",out.width="50%"}

knitr::include_graphics("figures/03-systems/lynx-hare.png")

```

Figure \@ref(fig:lynx-hare-time) timeseries of their population is shown with this figure from @stenseth_population_1997.


```{r,label="lynx-hare-time", echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A timeseries of the combined lynx and hare system.  Notice how the populations are coupled with each other.",out.width="50%"}

knitr::include_graphics("figures/03-systems/lynx-hare-timeseries.png")

```

Notice how in Figure \@ref(fig:lynx-hare-time) both populations seem to fluctuate periodically.  One plausible reason is that the lynx prey on the snowshoe hares, which causes the population to initially decline.  Once the snowshoe hare population declines, then there is less food for the lynx to survive, so their population declines.  The decline in the lynx population causes the hare population to increase, and so on it goes ...


In summary it is safe to say that the two populations are *coupled* to one another.  But in order to understand how they are coupled together, first let's consider the two populations *separately*.


The hares grow much more quickly than then lynx - in fact some hares have been known to reproduce several times a year.  A reasonable assumption for large hare populations is that rate of change of the hares is proportional to the hare population.  Based on this assumption Equation \@ref(eq:hareOnly) describes the rate of change of the hare population, with $H$ is the population of the hares:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dH}{dt} = r H (\#eq:hareOnly)
\end{equation}

In this case we know that the growth rate $r$ is positive, so then the rate of change ($H'$) will be positive as well, and $H$ will be increasing. Typical values given for $r$ in @stenseth_population_1997 are between 1.8 - 2.0 year$^{-1}$.  You may be thinking that the units on $r$ seem odd - (year$^{-1}$).  Another way to think about $r$ is to take its inverse: $r^{-1} \approx$  0.5 - 0.55 years.  Then $r^{-1}$ represents the amount of time that passes before the hare population increases (pretty short!)

Let's consider the lynx now.  A approach is to assume their population declines exponentially, or changes at the rate proportional to the current population.  Let's consider $L$ to be the lynx population, with the following differential equation (Equation \@ref(eq:lynxOnly)):

\begin{equation}
\frac{dL}{dt} = -dL (\#eq:lynxOnly)
\end{equation}

We assume the death rate $d$ in Equation \@ref(eq:lynxOnly) is positive, leading to a negative rate of change for the Lynx population (and a decreasing value for $L$).  Typical values of $d$ are 0.9 - 2.4 year$^{-1}$.  Similar to $r$, another way to understand $d$ is to take its inverse (about 0.4 - 1.1 years), which represents the amount of time that passes before the lynx population decreases by one.

The next part to consider is how the lynx and hare interact.  Since the hares are prey for the lynx, when the lynx hunt, the hare population decreases.  We can represent the process of hunting with the following adjustment to our hare equation:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dH}{dt} = r H - b HL
\end{equation}

So the parameter $b$ represents the hunting rate.  Notice how we have the term $HL$ for this interaction.  This term injects a sense of realism: if the lynx are not present ($L=0$), then the hare population can't decrease due to hunting.  We say that the *interaction* between the hares and the lynx with multiplication.  Typical values for $b$ are 480 - 870 hares $\cdot$ lynx$^{-1}$ year$^{-1}$.  It is okay if that unit seems a little odd to you - it should be!  Here is one way to think about it.  The quantity $\displaystyle \frac{dH}{dt}$ represents the *rate of change* of the hares, so it should have units of hares per year.  Since the term $bHL$ has both lynx and hare, the units for $b$ need to account for this.

How does hunting affect the lynx population?  One possibility is that it increases the lynx population:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dL}{dt} =bHL -dL
\end{equation}

Notice the symmetry between the rate of change for the hares and the lynx equations.  In many cases this makes sense - if you subtract a rate from one population, then that rate should be added to the receiving population.  You could also argue that there is some efficiency loss in converting the hares to lynx - not all of the hare is converted into lynx biomass.  In this situation we sometimes like to adjust the hunting term for the lynx equation with another parameter $e$, representing the efficiency that hares are converted into lynx:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dL}{dt} =e\cdot bHL -dL
\end{equation}

(sometimes people just make a new parameter $c=e \cdot b$, but for now we will just leave it as is).  Equation \@ref(eq:lynx-hare-combined) shows the coupled system of differential equations:

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\frac{dH}{dt} &= r H - b HL \\
\frac{dL}{dt} &=ebHL -dL
\end{split}
(\#eq:lynx-hare-combined)
\end{equation}

The schematic diagram representing these interactions is the following is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:lynxhare-schematic):

```{tikz, lynxhare-schematic,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,echo=FALSE,fig.align="center",fig.cap="Schematic diagram Lynx-Hare system."}


\tikzstyle{vspecies}=[rectangle,minimum size=0.5cm,draw=black]
\begin{tikzpicture}[auto, outer sep=1pt, node distance=2cm]

\node [vspecies] (H) {$H$} ;
\node [vspecies, right of = H] (L) {$L$} ;
\draw [->] ([yshift=3pt]H.east) --  node[above] {\small{$ebH$}} ([yshift=3pt]L.west) ;
% \draw [->] ([yshift=-3pt]L.west) --  node[below] {\small{$ebL$}} ([yshift=-3pt]H.east) ;

\draw [<-] (H.west) --  node[above] {\small{$r$}} +(-1cm,0pt) ;

\end{tikzpicture}


```



Equation \@ref(eq:lynx-hare-combined) is a classical model in mathematical biology and differential equations - it is called the *predator prey* model, also known as the [Lotka-Volterra equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equations).  There is a lot of interesting mathematics from this system of equations that we will study later in this textbook.  In later sections we will graphically and numerically analyze these equations and their solutions.


## The Law of Mass Action
Notice in the previous section that the interaction between the lynx and the hare was of the form *bHL* - meaning you needed both positive values of *H* and *L* for the interaction to continue.  This law states that the rate of a change is directly proportional to the *product* of the populations.

This assumption of the law of mass action is also commonly used in chemical reactions - especially in modeling enzyme dynamics.  For example let's say you have a substrate *A* that reactions with enzyme *B* to form a product *S*.  Perhaps you might have seen this represented as a reaction equation:

\begin{equation}
A+B \rightarrow S
\end{equation}

How we would write the product of formation, or $\displaystyle \frac{dS}{dt}$ is the following:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dS}{dt}= kAB,
\end{equation}

where $k$ is the proportionality constant or the rate constant associated with the reaction.  If we wanted to represent this as a schematic we would have the following diagram (Figure \@ref(fig:mass-action)):

```{tikz, mass-action,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,echo=FALSE,fig.align="center",fig.cap="Schematic diagram of the law of mass action."}

\tikzstyle{vspecies}=[rectangle,minimum size=0.5cm,draw=black]
\begin{tikzpicture}[auto, outer sep=1pt, node distance=2cm]

\node [vspecies] (A) {$A$} ;
\node [vspecies, right of = A] (S) {$S$} ;
\draw [->] ([yshift=0pt]A.east) --  node[above] {\small{$kB$}} ([yshift=0pt]S.west) ;
\end{tikzpicture}


```

We could also consider if there was a constant decay of the substrate, which we might revise Figure \@ref(fig:mass-action) to Figure \@ref(fig:mass-action-revised):

```{tikz, mass-action-revised,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,echo=FALSE,fig.align="center",fig.cap="Revised schematic diagram of the law of mass action with decay."}


\tikzstyle{vspecies}=[rectangle,minimum size=0.5cm,draw=black]
\begin{tikzpicture}[auto, outer sep=1pt, node distance=2cm]

\node [vspecies] (A) {$A$} ;
\node [vspecies, right of = A] (S) {$S$} ;
\draw [->] ([yshift=0pt]A.east) --  node[above] {\small{$kB$}} ([yshift=0pt]S.west) ;
\draw [->] (S.east) --  node[above] {\small{$d$}} +(1cm,0pt) ;
\end{tikzpicture}


```

For this case, the rate of change of $S$ would then be:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dS}{dt}= kAB - dS, (\#eq:mass-action-decay)
\end{equation}

You may be wondering about rates for $A$ and $B$. When $S$ is formed $A$ and $B$ are catalyzed, so the rate of formation for $S$ (the positive term in Equation \@ref(eq:mass-action-decay)) will be a loss for $A$ and $B$ (Equation \@ref(eq:mass-action-ab)):

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\frac{dA}{dt} &= -kAB \\
\frac{dB}{dt} &= -kAB
\end{split}
(\#eq:mass-action-ab)
\end{equation}


Both equations are similar in this case, not pending any additional inputs or outputs.

## Establishing species
Let's look at another example where from we will determine a differential equation model from a context:


> A newly introduced plant species is introduced to a region.  It competes with another established species for nutrients (and is a better competitor).  However, the growth rate of the new species is proportional to the difference between the current number of established species and the number of new species.  You may assume that the number of established species is a constant _E_.


<!-- LW pg 5 -->


For this problem we will start by naming our variables.  Let $N$ represent number of new species and $E$ the number of established species.  We will break this down accordingly:

- *"the growth rate of the new species"* means $\displaystyle \frac{dN}{dt}$.
- *"is proportional to the difference between the current number of established species and the number of new species"* means $\displaystyle k \cdot (E-N)$, where $k$ is the proportionality constant.  Including this parameter helps to avoid assuming we have a 1:1 correspondence between the growth rate of the new species and the population difference.
- *"and is a better competitor"* helps to explain why the term is $\displaystyle k \cdot (E-N)$ insteady of $\displaystyle k \cdot (N-E)$.  We know that the newly established species will start out in much smaller numbers than $N$.  But since it is a better competitor, we would expect its rate to increase initially.  So $\displaystyle \frac{dN}{dt}$ should be *positive* rather than negative.  Assuming $N < E$, then $E-N > 0$, which guarantees that the new species will grow.


So this description could be modeled with Equation \@ref(eq:compete-03):
\begin{equation}
\frac{dN}{dt} = k(E-N) (\#eq:compete-03)
\end{equation}

Does Equation \@ref(eq:compete-03) seem familiar to you?  It is similar to Equation \@ref(eq:single-02) in Section \@ref(intro-01) for the spread of Ebola!  While this may seem surprising, it is often the case that similar equations appear in different contexts. So do you have to memorize every possible model for every possible context? The answer is emphatically *NO*! Rather it is more advantageous to learn how to analyze models qualitatively rather than memorize several different types of models and not see the connections between them.

An interesting solution to a differential equation is the _steady state_ or _equilibrium_ solution.  We find this where the rate equals zero.  Let's take a look how to do that for our establishing plant model

```{example}
What is the steady state value for the differential equation $\displaystyle \frac{dE}{dt} = k(E-N)$?  (That is solve for $E$ when $\displaystyle \frac{dE}{dt} = 0$.)
```

```{solution}
Let's solve $\displaystyle \frac{dE}{dt} = k(E-N)  = 0$.  For this equation we want to express the right hand side in terms of $E$.  The parameter $k$ is a constant $k > 0$, so really the steady state occurs when $E-N = 0$, or when $N = E$.
```

What this model tells us that eventually the new species will overtake the established species $E$.

<!-- LW pg 73 has some good examples, derived in handlingh patches. -->
## Other types of functional responses 
In several examples we have seen a rate of change proportional to the current population, as in the rate of growth of the hare population is $rH$.  This is one example of what we would call a [functional response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_response).  Another type of functional response assumes that the rate reaches a limiting value proportional to the population size, so $\displaystyle \frac{dH}{dt} = \frac{rH}{1+arH}$. This is an example of a **type II functional response**.  Finally, the type II response has also been generalized (a **type III functional response**) $\displaystyle \frac{dH}{dt} = \frac{rH^{2}}{1+arH^{2}}$. Figure \@ref(fig:function-response) shows all three functional responses together:

```{r function-response,echo=FALSE,fig.width=5,fig.height=4,fig.cap="Comparison between Type I - Type III functional responses."}
x <- seq(0,2,by=.01)

  
type1 <-  .5*x
type2 <- 2*x/(1+2*x)
type3 <- 4*x^2/(1+4*x^2)

my_data <- data.frame(x,type1,type2,type3) %>%
  gather(key=type,value=value,-x)
ggplot() +
  geom_line(data=my_data,aes(x=x,y=value,color=type),size=1.0) +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(size=20),
          axis.title.x=element_text(size=20),
          axis.text.x=element_text(size=15),
          axis.text.y=element_text(size=15),
          axis.title.y=element_text(size=20),
          legend.position = 'bottom') +
    labs(x='x',y = 'Rate') +
  scale_color_discrete(name="Functional \n Response",
                      labels=c("Type I", "Type II","Type III"))



```

Notice the limiting behavior in the Type II and Type III functional responses.  These responses are commonly used in ecology and predator-prey dynamics and in problems of how animals search for food.

## Exercises
```{exercise}
Consider the following type of functional responses:
\begin{align}
\mbox{ Type I: } \frac{dP}{dt} &= 0.1 P \\

\mbox{ Type III: } \frac{dP}{dt} &= \frac{0.1P^{2}}{1+.05P^{2}}
\end{align} 
  
For each of the functional responses evaluate $\displaystyle \lim_{P \rightarrow \infty} \frac{dP}{dt}$.  Since these functional responses represent a rate of change of a population, what are some examples (hypothetical or actual) would each of these responses be appropriate?

<!-- Thornley and Johnson. Logan and Wollesensky pg 4 -->
```{exercise}
For each of the following exercises consider the following contextual situations modeling rates of change.  Name variables for each situation and write down a differential equation describing the context. Be sure to identify and briefly describe any parameters you need for your model. For each problem you will need to:


- Name and describe all variables.
- Write down a differential equation.
- Identify and describe any parameters needed.
- Write a brief one-two sentence explanation of why your differential equation models the situation at hand.
- Hand sketch a rough graph of what you think the solution as a function of time - *note:* your solution needs to be consistent with your explanation and vice versa.




a. The rate of change of an animal's body temperature is proportional to the difference in temperature between the environment.
b. A plant grows propritional to its current length $L$.  Assume this proportionality constant is $\mu$, whose rate also decreases proportional to its current value.  You will need to write down a system of two equation with variables $L$ and $\mu$.
c. A patient undergoing chemotherapy receives an injection at rate $I$. This injection decreases the rate that a tumor accumulates mass. Independent of the injection, the tumor accumulates mass at a rate proportional to the mass of the tumor.
d. A cell with radius $r$ assimilates nutrients at a rate proportional to its surface area, but uses nutrients proportional to its volume. Determine an equation that represents the rate of change of the radius. 
e. A patient undergoing chemotherapy receives an injection at rate $I$. This injection decreases the rate that a tumor accumulates mass. Independent of the injection, the tumor accumulates mass at a rate proportional to the mass of the tumor.
f. The rate that a cancer cell divides (increases in amount) is proportional to the amount of healthy cells in its surrounding environment.  You may assume that a healthy cell has a mortality $\delta_{H}$ and a cancer cell has mortality $\delta_{C}$.  Be sure to write down a system of differential equations for the population of cancer cells $C$ and healthy cells $H$.
g. The rate that a virus is spread to the population is proportional to the probability that a person is sick (out of $N$ total sick and healthy individuals).

You are tasked with the job of investigating the effect of a pesticide on water quality, in terms of its effects on the health of the plants and fish in the ecosystem.  Different models can be created that investigate the effect of the pesticide.  Different types of reaction schemes for this system are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:pesticide-ch3), where $F$ represents the amount of pesticide in the fish, $W$ the amount of pesticide in the water, and $S$ the amount of pesticide in the soil.  The prime (e.g. $F'$, $W'$, and $S'$ represent other bound forms of the respective state).  In all seven different models can be derived. For each of the model schematics, apply the Law of Mass Action to write down a system of differential equations.
