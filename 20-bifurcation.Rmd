# Bifurcation {#bifurcation-20}

In this section we will study a key topic that applies qualititative stability analysis from Section \@ref(stability-19) to examine how stability of an equilibrium solution is sensitivity to parameters. This general topic is called *bifurcation*, and to illustrate what bifurcation is we will examine several examples.

## A series of equations
First let's consider the differential equation $\displaystyle \frac{dx}{dt} = 1-x^{2}$. This equation has an equibrium solution at $x=\pm 1$.  To classify the stability of the equilibrium solutions we apply the following test (developed in Section \@ref(phase-05)):


- If $f'(y_{*})â€™>0$ at an equilibrium solution, the equilibrium solution $y=y_{*}$ will be unstable.
- If $f'(y_{*}) <0$ at an equilibrium solution, the equilibrium solution $y=y_{*}$ will be stable.
- If $f'(y_{*}) = 0$, we cannot conclude anything about the stability of $y=y_{*}$.

Applying this test, we know $f(x)=1-x^2$ and $f'(x)=-2x$.  Since $f'(1)=-2$ and $f'(-1)=2$, then the equilibrium solution $x=1$ is stable and $x=-1$ unstable.

Figure \@ref(fig:eq1-x2) shows a plot of the phase plane along with some solutions. Notice how the solutions seem to flow to $x=1$ and away from $x=-1$.

```{r eq1-x2, echo=FALSE,fig.width=5,fig.height=4,results='hide',warning=FALSE,fig.cap="Phase plane of $x'=1-x^{2}$"}
system_eq <- c(dxdt ~ 1,
               dydt ~ 1-y^2)


system_eq_rev <- c(dxdt ~ 1-x^2)

initialCondition <- tibble(value = c(2,1.5,1,0.5,0,-0.5,-1,-1.5,-2),sim=1:9,vector="x") %>% relocate(vector) %>%
  group_by(sim) %>%
  nest()


out_values <- initialCondition %>%
  mutate(result = map(.x=data,.f=~rk4(system_eq_rev,
                                      initial_condition=deframe(.x),
                                      deltaT=.1,
                                      n_steps = 200))) %>%
  select(-data) %>%
  unnest(cols=c(result))


phaseplane(system_eq,'x','y',c(-0.1,2),c(-2,2)) +
  geom_line(data=out_values,aes(x=t,y=x,color=as.factor(sim),group=sim),inherit.aes = TRUE,size=1.5) + xlim(c(-0.1,2)) + ylim(c(-2,2)) + guides(color="none")+ ggtitle(expression("dx/dt = 1"~-x^2)) + xlab("t") + ylab("x")

```


Let's modify and extend this example further. Consider two more differential equations:

 - $\displaystyle \frac{dx}{dt} = -1-x^{2}$: This differential equation does not have any equilibrium solutions, so we do not need to apply the stability test.
 - $\displaystyle \frac{dx}{dt} = -x^{2}$:  The stability of the second equation is a little more tricky.  While it has an equilibrium solution at $x=0$, the stability test cannot apply because $f'=-2x$ and $f'(0)=0$.  However investigating the sign of $f(x)$ to the left and right of $x=0$, we see that this solution is constantly decreasing, so the equilibrium is unstable.

So let's also take a look at the phaseplanes for $\displaystyle \frac{dx}{dt} = -1-x^{2}$ and $\displaystyle \frac{dx}{dt} = -x^{2}$ along with the some solution curves (see also the accompanying figure).

```{r eq1-x2-2, echo=FALSE,fig.width=3.5,fig.height=3,results='hide',warning=FALSE,fig.ncol=1,fig.cap="Phase plane of $x'=-1-x^{2}$ and $x'=-x^{2}$"}
system_eq <- c(dxdt ~ 1,
               dydt ~ -1-y^2)


system_eq_rev <- c(dxdt ~ -1-x^2)

initialCondition <- tibble(value = c(2,1.5,1,0.5,0,-0.5,-1,-1.5,-2),sim=1:9,vector="x") %>% relocate(vector) %>%
  group_by(sim) %>%
  nest()


out_values <- initialCondition %>%
  mutate(result = map(.x=data,.f=~rk4(system_eq_rev,
                                      initial_condition=deframe(.x),
                                      deltaT=.1,
                                      n_steps = 200))) %>%
  select(-data) %>%
  unnest(cols=c(result))


phaseplane(system_eq,'x','y',c(-0.1,2),c(-2,2)) +
  geom_line(data=out_values,aes(x=t,y=x,color=as.factor(sim),group=sim),inherit.aes = TRUE,size=1.5) + xlim(c(-0.1,2)) + ylim(c(-2,2)) + guides(color="none")+ ggtitle(expression("dx/dt = -1"~-x^2)) + xlab("t") + ylab("x")

###
system_eq <- c(dxdt ~ 1,
               dydt ~ -y^2)


system_eq_rev <- c(dxdt ~ -x^2)

initialCondition <- tibble(value = c(2,1.5,1,0.5,0,-0.5,-1,-1.5,-2),sim=1:9,vector="x") %>% relocate(vector) %>%
  group_by(sim) %>%
  nest()


out_values <- initialCondition %>%
  mutate(result = map(.x=data,.f=~rk4(system_eq_rev,
                                      initial_condition=deframe(.x),
                                      deltaT=.1,
                                      n_steps = 200))) %>%
  select(-data) %>%
  unnest(cols=c(result))


phaseplane(system_eq,'x','y',c(-0.1,2),c(-2,2)) +
  geom_line(data=out_values,aes(x=t,y=x,color=as.factor(sim),group=sim),inherit.aes = TRUE,size=1.5) + xlim(c(-0.1,2)) + ylim(c(-2,2)) + guides(color="none")+ ggtitle(expression("dx/dt ="~-x^2)) + xlab("t") + ylab("x")

```


There is an interesting pattern going on here. Let's build on these three examples in a more general context. Consider the differential equation $\displaystyle \frac{dx}{dt} = c-x^{2}$. In our first example, $c=1$. In the second example, $c=-1$, and the third example $c=0$. The phaseplanes from these examples illustrates how the value of $c$ influences the phase line and the resulting solution.

Steady states to $\displaystyle \frac{dx}{dt} = c-x^{2}$ are at $x^{*}=\pm \sqrt{c}$. We can also test out the stability of our steady states using the stability test, with $f(x)=c-x^{2}$ and $f'(x)=-2x$: 

- If $c>0$ we have two steady states, summarized in the following table:

Equilibrium solution | $f'(x^{*})$  | Tendency of solution | 
-------------| ------------- | ------------- | 
    $x^{*}=\sqrt{c}$ | $-2 \sqrt{c}$ | Stable 
    $x^{*}=-\sqrt{c}$ |  $2 \sqrt{c}$ | Unstable 

(You should verify that the stability result we initially found when $c=1$ matches the table.)

- If $c=0$ there is only one steady state, summarized, in the following table:

Equilibrium solution | $f'(x^{*})$  | Tendency of solution | 
-------------| ------------- | ------------- | 
   $x^{*}=0$  | 0 | Inconclusive 

Based on the phaseplane for $x'=-x^{2}$, the equilibrium solution $x^{*}=0$ is unstable.  If the initial condition $x(0)$ is greater than 0, the solution flows towards $x=0$, but if the initial condition is less than zero, the solution flows away from $x=0$.  This is similar to a one-dimensional analogue to a saddle node from Section \@ref(stability-19).

- Finally, if $c<0$, then there are no steady states because $\sqrt{c}$ is does not have a real solution when $c<0$.  (Note: eigenvalues can be imaginary, but equilibrium solutions for our contexts can only be real). We can also test out the stability of our steady states using the stability test, with $f(x)=c-x^{2}$ and $f'(x)=-2x$:



Notice how different values of $c$ influence both the *value* $(x^{*}=\pm \sqrt{c})$ and the *stability* of the equilibrium solution. Rather than making a series of tables, we can represent the dependence of the equilibrium solution and its stability in what is called a *bifurcation diagram* (Figure \@ref(fig:saddle-bifur-20)).

```{r saddle-bifur-20,engine='tikz',warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,echo=FALSE,fig.cap='A saddle-node bifurcation',fig.align='center'}


\begin{tikzpicture}
%\draw[help lines, color=gray!30, dashed] (-4.9,-4.9) grid (4.9,4.9);
\draw[<->,ultra thick] (-3,0)--(3,0) node[right]{$c$};
\draw[<->,ultra thick] (0,-1)--(0,3) node[above]{$x^{*}$};
\draw[->,thick,scale=0.5,domain=0:5,smooth,variable=\x,blue] plot (\x,{sqrt(\x)});
\draw[->,thick,scale=0.5,domain=0:5,dashed,variable=\x,blue] plot (\x,-{sqrt(\x)});
\node at (3,-1.5) {Unstable};
\node at (3,1.5) {Stable};

\end{tikzpicture}


```
Let's talk about Figure \@ref(fig:saddle-bifur-20). The graph represents the value of the equilibrium solution ($x^{*}$, vertical axis) as a function of the parameter $c$ (horizontal axis).  Since equilibrium solutions are characterized by $x^{*}=\pm \sqrt{c}$ we have the "sideways parabola", traced in blue in Figure \@ref(fig:saddle-bifur-20).  When $c<0$, there is no equilibrium solution, (so nothing is plotted in the second and third quadrants of Figure \@ref(fig:saddle-bifur-20)). The difference between the solid and dashed lines in Figure \@ref(fig:saddle-bifur-20) is used to distinguish between a stable equilibrium solution ($x^{*}=\sqrt{c}$ when $c>0$) and unstable equilibrium solution ($x^{*}=-\sqrt{c}$ when $c>0$). That is so cool that *all* the information about the equilibrium solution and its stability is contained in this diagram!

This particular example is called a *saddle-node* bifurcation.  It might be helpful to think of this $c$ like a tuning knob.  As $c>0$ we will always have two different equilibrium solutions that are symmetrical based on the value of $c$.  The positive one will be stable, the other unstable.  As $c$ gets smaller these equilbrium solutions will collapse into one, which will be unstable.  If $c$ is negative, the equilibrium solution disappears.

## Bifurcations with systems of equations 

As another example, let's determine the behavior of solutions near the origin for the system of equations:
 \begin{equation}
 \frac{\vec{dx}}{dt} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 & b \\ 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \vec{x}. (\#eq:b-bifurc-20)
 \end{equation}

Let's take a look at the phase plane with solution curves.

```{r bifuc-b-20, echo=FALSE,fig.width=3.5,fig.height=3,results='hide',warning=FALSE,fig.cap="Comparison of two phase planes for Equation \\@ref(eq:b-bifurc-20)"}
eq_1 <- c( dx ~ 3*x + -1, dy~x+y)

initialCondition <- tibble(x = c(1,-1,1,-1),
                           y = c(1,1,-1,-1),
                           sim = 1:4) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols=c("x","y")) %>%
  group_by(sim) %>%
  nest()

out_values <- initialCondition %>%
  mutate(result = map(.x=data,.f=~rk4(eq_1,
                                      initial_condition=deframe(.x),
                                      deltaT=.1,
                                      n_steps = 200))) %>%
  select(-data) %>%
  unnest(cols=c(result))

phaseplane(eq_1,'x','y',c(-5,5),c(-5,5)) +
  geom_line(data=out_values,aes(x=x,y=y,color=as.factor(sim),group=sim),inherit.aes = TRUE,size=1.5) + xlim(c(-5,5)) + ylim(c(-5,5)) + guides(color="none")+ ggtitle(expression("b = -1"))

###


eq_2 <- c( dx ~ 3*x + 4, dy~x+y)

initialCondition <- tibble(x = c(1,-1,1,-1),
                           y = c(1,1,-1,-1),
                           sim = 1:4) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols=c("x","y")) %>%
  group_by(sim) %>%
  nest()

out_values <- initialCondition %>%
  mutate(result = map(.x=data,.f=~rk4(eq_2,
                                      initial_condition=deframe(.x),
                                      deltaT=.1,
                                      n_steps = 200))) %>%
  select(-data) %>%
  unnest(cols=c(result))

phaseplane(eq_2,'x','y',c(-5,5),c(-5,5)) +
  geom_line(data=out_values,aes(x=x,y=y,color=as.factor(sim),group=sim),inherit.aes = TRUE,size=1.5) + xlim(c(-5,5)) + ylim(c(-5,5)) + guides(color="none")+ ggtitle(expression("b = 4"))

```


This equation has one free parameter $b$ that we will analyze using the trace determinant conditions developed in Section \@ref(stability-19). Let's call the matrix $A$, so the tr$(A)=4$ and $\det(A)=3-b$.  Since the trace is always positive either it will be a saddle if the $\det(A)<0$, or when $3<b$.  We have a unstable spiral when $3>b$ and $(\mbox{tr}(A))^2-4 \det(A)<0$, or when $4^2-4\cdot(3-b) = 16-12+4b = 4+4b<0$, which leads to $b<-1$.  Notice this is a contradictory condition - we have already assumed $b>3$, so we will not have any unstable spirals.

To summarize, we have the following dynamics:

- When $b<3$ the equilibrium solution will be a saddle.
- When $b=3$ we will have an unstable solution.
- When $b>3$ we will have a unstable node.


The benefit of a bifurcation diagram is that is provides a complete understanding of the dynamics of the system *as a function of the parameters*.  In this section we examined *one-parameter* bifurcations (for example we looked the stability of the equilibrium solution as it depends on *c* or *b*), but bifurcations can also be extended further to two parameter bifurcation families, applying similar methods.  In general the methods are similar to what we have done.

## Limit Cycles and Bifurcations with systems of equations 
The previous examples we have studied examine the stability of an equilibrium solution as a parameter changes. An extension of an equilibrium solution (as a point in space) is an equilibrium solution that is a *function*. 

 Consider the following highly nonlinear system:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\frac{dx}{dt} =-y-x(x^2+y^2-1) \\ 
\frac{dy}{dt}=x-y(x^2+y^2-1)
\end{split} (\#eq:limit-cycle-20)
\end{equation}

The phase plane for Equation \@ref(eq:limit-cycle-20) is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:phase-limit-20). You can verify that Equation \@ref(eq:limit-cycle-20) system has an equilibrium solution at the point  $x=0$, $y=0$. 

```{r phase-limit-20, echo=FALSE,out.width = "4in",fig.cap="Phase plane for Equation \\ref(eq:limit-cycle-20)"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/20-bifurcation/limitCycles.png")
```

 
However the phase plane suggests there might be other equilibrium solutions. To further explore this, let's look at the phase plane with some solution curves in Figure \@ref(fig:limit-cycle-20-f):

```{r limit-cycle-20-f, warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE,fig.width=4,fig.height=4,fig.cap="Phase plane with solutions curves for Equation \\@ref(eq:limit-cycle-20)"}
mu <- 1

mu_eq <- c( dx ~ -y-x*(x^2+y^2-1), dy~x-y*(x^2+y^2-1))


initialCondition <- tibble(x = c(1,0.3,0.7,-0.3,0.7,0.7,0.9,1.1),
                           y = c(0.5,.5,.5,.5,-0.5,-0.5,0,0.5),
                           sim = 1:8) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols=c("x","y")) %>%
  group_by(sim) %>%
  nest()


out_values <- initialCondition %>%
  mutate(result = map(.x=data,.f=~rk4(mu_eq,
                                      initial_condition=deframe(.x),
                                      deltaT=.1,
                                      n_steps = 200))) %>%
  select(-data) %>%
  unnest(cols=c(result))

phaseplane(mu_eq,'x','y',c(-1.5,1.5),c(-1.5,1.5)) +
  geom_point(data=out_values,aes(x=x,y=y,color=as.factor(sim),group=sim),inherit.aes = TRUE,size=1.5) + xlim(c(-1.5,1.5)) + ylim(c(-1.5,1.5)) + guides(color="none")


```

What is interesting in Figure \@ref(fig:limit-cycle-20-f) that the solution is tending towards a circle of radius 1 (or the equation $x^{2}+y^{2}=1$). This is an example of an equilibrium solution that is a *curve* rather than a specific point.  We can transform this system from $x$ and $y$ to a single new variables $X$ (see Exercise \@ref(exr:limit-transform-20)).

\begin{equation}
\frac{dX}{dt} = -X(X-1), \mbox{ where } X=r^{2}. (\#eq:limit-X-20)
\end{equation}

How Equation \@ref(eq:limit-cycle-20) transforms to Equation \@ref(eq:limit-X-20) is by applying a polar coordinate transformation to this system.  By applying stability analysis for Equation \@ref(eq:limit-X-20) we can show that the equilibrium solution $X=0$ is unstable (meaning the origin $x=0$ and $y=0$ is an unstable solution) and the circle of radius 1 is stable (which is the equation $x^{2}+y^{2}=1$). In this case we would say $r=1$ is a *stable limit cycle*.  You will study a similar system in Exercises \@ref(exr:limit-transform-20) and \@ref(exr:hopf-20).

Equation \@ref(eq:limit-X-20) is an example of next steps with studying the qualitative analysis of systems.  While we have focused on bifurcation of equilibrium solutions, hopefully this brief introduction will pique your interest in further study of bifurcations.

The most important part in studying bifurcations is analyzing examples.  I've provided a lot of exercises where you will construct bifurcation diagrams for one and two-dimensional equations.  Given an equation with a parameter, it is helpful to construct some sample phaselines / phaseplanes before analyzing stability in general using the stability test or the trace-determinant plane.
