# Coupled systems of equations
In this section we will learn how to qualitatively understand systems of differential equations.  When analyzing a single differential equation we used the idea of a phase line to understand if a solution was stable or unstable.  Here we extend that to equations of more than one variable and investigate what we will call the *phase plane*.

## Model redux: flu with quarantine

A few sections ago we studied the following coupled model for a flu:


\begin{align*}
\frac{dS}{dt} &= -kSI \\
\frac{dI}{dt} &= kSI
\end{align*}

In this scenario we are also going to consider that those who are infected are quarantined, proportional to the number infected, according to the following schematic:

```{r quarantine,engine='tikz',warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
\begin{center}
\tikzstyle{vspecies}=[rectangle,minimum size=0.5cm,draw=black]
\begin{tikzpicture}[auto, outer sep=1pt, node distance=2cm]

\node [vspecies] (S) {$S$} ;
\node [vspecies, right of = S] (I) {$I$} ;
\draw [->,thick] (S) --  node {\small{$k$}} (I) ;
\draw [->,thick] (I.south) --  node[right] {\small{$\beta$}} +(0pt,-1cm) ;
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
```


Which gives us the following system of equations:
\begin{align*}
\frac{dS}{dt} &= -kSI \\
\frac{dI}{dt} &= kSI - \beta I
\end{align*}

In the last section we studied the qualitative analysis of a differential equation by finding equilibrium solutions.  In this case the solution was where the rates were in steady state.

For a multivariable system of equations, the same idea holds, but we want to investigate curves where $S'$ and $I'$ equal zero.  We call these curves the *nullclines*

For this example $S'=0$ when $-k S I =0$, so the nullcline is the equation $S=0$ or $I=0$. In the other hand, when $I'=0$ when $k S - \beta I = 0$ which means that either $I=0$, or $\displaystyle I = \frac{\beta}{k} S$.  Notice how this nullcline depends as a function of $S$. At this point it is helpful to visualize these nullclines in the plane (since we have two equations), with $S$ on the horizontal axis and $I$ on the vertical axis.



```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=4,fig.height=3}
k <- 1
beta <-1
ggplot(data.frame(x=c(0,2)), aes(x))  +
  labs(x = "S",y = "I") +
  stat_function(fun=function(x)beta/k*x, geom="line", aes(colour="I'=0"),size=2) +
  stat_function(fun=function(x)0, geom="line", aes(colour="S'=0"),size=2) +
  stat_function(fun=function(x)0, geom="line", aes(colour="I'=0"),size=2,linetype=2,inherit.aes = TRUE) +
geom_segment(data=data.frame(x1=0,x2=0,y1=0,y2=2),aes(x=x1,xend=x2,y=y1,yend=y2,colour="S'=0"),size=2,inherit.aes = TRUE) +
  scale_color_discrete(name="Nullclines")


```

One thing to note on the above graphic: there is a nullcline for $S$ and $I$ along the horizontal axis. A key thing to note is that where two different nullclines cross is an *equilibrium solution* to the system of equations.  This means that **both** $S'$ and $I'$ are zero at this point.  This looks like the nullclines cross when both $S=I=0$.

You may also notice that the entire horizontal axis is an equilibrium solution because the nullclines for $S$ and $I$ are the same curve.  There is a practical interpretation of these nullclines - whenever $I=0$, meaning there are no infected people around, the solution is at an equilibrium. 


Algebraically we can also verify that the origin is an equilibrium solution by substituting $S=0$ (what we found for $S$ in the first equation) into the second equation.


## A slope field
Let's go back to the idea of a phase plane, but this time we will plug in different values of $S$ and $I$ into our system of equations and plot out a little field.

We can think of these rates as mini-tangent lines.  In fact, let's evaluate the derivatives $\frac{dS}{dt}$ and $\frac{dI}{dt}$ for different values of $S$ and $I$. 


```{r, echo=FALSE}
dS <- function(S,I) {
  -k*S*I
}

dI <- function(S,I) {
  k*S*I-beta*I
}

S<- seq(0,2,length.out=5)
I <- seq(0,2,length.out=5)
model_out <- data.frame(S,I,dS_dt=dS(S,I),dI_dt=dI(S,I))
kable(model_out,caption = 'Phase Plane values')


```

Notice how the different values of $\displaystyle \frac{dS}{dt}$ and $\displaystyle \frac{dI}{dt}$ at each of the $S$ and $I$ values. We think of the coordinate pair of $\displaystyle \left( \frac{dS}{dt}, \frac{dI}{dt} \right)$ showing a vector in the $(S,I)$ plane. We associate  $\displaystyle \frac{dS}{dt}$ with left-right motion, so positive  $\displaystyle \frac{dx}{dt}$ means pointing to the right.  Likewise, we associate  $\displaystyle \frac{dI}{dt}$ with up-down motion, so positive  $\displaystyle \frac{dI}{dt}$ means the vector points up. At the point $(S,I)=(1,1)$, we have an arrow that points directly to the west because and $\displaystyle \frac{dI}{dt} < 0$ and $\displaystyle \frac{dI}{dt} =0$.  If we sequentially sample points in the $(S,I)$ plane we get a vector field plot, superimposed with the nullclines:

```{r, echo=FALSE,fig.width=4,fig.height=3}
phaseplane(20,c(0,2),c(0,2),'S','I',dS,dI) +
  stat_function(fun=function(x)beta/k*x, geom="line", aes(colour="I'=0"),size=2) +
  stat_function(fun=function(x)0, geom="line", aes(colour="S'=0"),size=2) +
  stat_function(fun=function(x)0, geom="line", aes(colour="I'=0"),size=2,linetype=2,inherit.aes = TRUE) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0,color='#00bfc4',size=2) +
#geom_segment(data=data.frame(x1=0,x2=0,y1=0,y2=2),aes(x=x1,xend=x2,y=y1,yend=y2,colour="S'=0"),size=2,inherit.aes='TRUE') +
  scale_color_discrete(name="Nullclines") +
  geom_point(aes(x=0,y=0),size=3)
```



## Motion around the nullclines

We can also extend the motion around the nullclines to investigate the stability. With a one dimensional differential equation we used a number line to quantify values where the solution is increasing / decreasing.  The problem with several differential equations is that the notion of "increasing" or "decreasing"" becomes difficult to understand - as there is an additional degree of freedom! Simply put, in a plane you can move left/right *or* up/down. The benefit for having nullclines is that they **isolate** the motion in one direction.  

In general for a two dimensional system: 
- Along the nullcline for the variable on the horizontal axis, the only motion is up/down.
- Along the nullcline for the variable on the vertical axis, the only motion is left/right.

For our model with the quarantine, if we choose points where $I'=0$ then we know that the only motion is to the left and the right because $S$ can still change along that curve.  If we choose points where $S'=0$ then we know that the only motion is to the up/down because $I$ can still change along that curve.


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=5,fig.height=4}

k <- 1
beta <-1
ggplot(data.frame(x=c(0,2)), aes(x))  +
  labs(x = "S",y = "I") +
  stat_function(fun=function(x)beta/k*x, geom="line", aes(colour="I'=0"),size=2) +
  stat_function(fun=function(x)0, geom="line", aes(colour="S'=0"),size=2) +
  stat_function(fun=function(x)0, geom="line", aes(colour="I'=0"),size=2,linetype=2,inherit.aes = TRUE) +
geom_segment(data=data.frame(x1=0,x2=0,y1=0,y2=2),aes(x=x1,xend=x2,y=y1,yend=y2,colour="S'=0"),size=2,inherit.aes = TRUE) +
  scale_color_discrete(name="Nullclines") +
  geom_text(aes(x=0.3,y=1.5,label="Along this curve \n you have only \n up/down motion"),hjust="left") +
  geom_text(aes(x=1.0,y=0.5,label="Along this curve \n you have only \n left/right motion"),hjust="left") +
  geom_curve(aes(x = 0.4, y = 1.25, xend = 0.05, yend = 1.0),
             curvature = 0.05, angle = 15,
             arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.25,"cm"))) +
  geom_curve(aes(x = 1.25, y = 0.70, xend = 1.25, yend = 1.20),
             curvature = 0.05, angle = 15,
             arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.25,"cm"))) 


```


## Determining stability
The picture of the phase plane with the nullcline qualitatively tells us about the stability of an equilibrium point.  Once of the equilibrium solutions is at the origin $(S,I)=(0,0)$.  As before we want to investigate if the equilibrium solution is stable or unstable.

We will zoom in a little more near the equilibrium solution:

```{r, echo=FALSE,fig.width=4,fig.height=3}
phaseplane(20,c(0,0.25),c(0,0.25),'S','I',dS,dI) +
  stat_function(fun=function(x)beta/k*x, geom="line", aes(colour="I'=0"),size=2) +
  stat_function(fun=function(x)0, geom="line", aes(colour="S'=0"),size=2) +
  stat_function(fun=function(x)0, geom="line", aes(colour="I'=0"),size=2,linetype=2,inherit.aes = TRUE) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0,color='#00bfc4',size=2) +
#geom_segment(data=data.frame(x1=0,x2=0,y1=0,y2=2),aes(x=x1,xend=x2,y=y1,yend=y2,colour="S'=0"),size=2,inherit.aes='TRUE') +
  scale_color_discrete(name="Nullclines") +
  geom_point(aes(x=0,y=0),size=3)
```


As you can see the arrows appear to be pointing into and towards the equilibrium solution.  So we would classify this equilbrium solution as *stable*.


## Generating a phase plane in `R`
The `MAT369Code` package has some basic functionality to generate a phase plane.  Let's say we have the following differential equations:

\begin{align}
\frac{dx}{dt} &= x-y \\
\frac{dy}{dt} &= -x+y
\end{align}


In order to analyze these we need to define functions for $x'$ and $y'$, which I will annotate as $dx$ and $dy$ respectively:

```{r}
dx <- function(x,y) {
  x-y
}

dy <- function(x,y) {
  x+y
}

```

Then what we do is apply the command `phaseplane`, which will generate a vector field of $N$ points over a domain:

```{r,fig.width=4,fig.height=3,}
n_points <- 5  # Number of points we want to sample our vector field.

# Define the range we wish to evaluate this vector field
x <- c(-2,2)
y <- c(-2,2)

phaseplane(20,x,y,'x','y',dx,dy)  # The values in quotes are the labels for the axes


```


## More refined numerical solvers
Perhaps in the course of working with Euler's method you encounter a differential equation that produces some nonsensible results.  Take for example the following which is the implementation of our quarantine model:

```{r,fig.width=4,fig.height=3}
deltaT <- .1    # timestep length
timeSteps <- 15   # must be a number greater than 1

parameters <- c(k=.05, beta=.2)   # parameters: a named vector

initialCondition <- c(S=300, I=1)  # Be sure you have enough conditions as you do variables.

dynamics <- function(t, state, parameters){
  with(as.list(c(state, parameters)), {  # Do not edit this line
    dS = -k*S*I  # <-- You may edit this line
    dI = k*S*I-beta*I # <-- You may edit this line.
    return(list(c(dS, dI)))  # <-- If you have more equations you will need to list the dVariables
  })
}


euler(deltaT,timeSteps,initialCondition,FUN=dynamics,parameters=parameters)
```

You may notice the solution for $S$ wiggles around $t=0.75$ and is negative.  This is concerning because we know there can't be negative people!  This requires a little more investigation.

If we take a look at $t=0.75$ the value for $S \approx 1$ and the value for $I \approx 280$.  If we let $k=0.05$ and $\beta=0.2$, this means that $\displaystyle \frac{dS}{dt}=-14$ and $\displaystyle \frac{dI}{dt}=-42$.  The values of $S$ and $I$ are both decreasing!  We know that our Euler's method update is one where the new value is the old value plus any change.  So the new value for $S = 1 -14\cdot 0.1 = -0.4$.  Mathematically Euler's method is doing nothing incorrect, but we know realistically this cannot happen.

In turns out that this can easily be overcome.  While Euler's method is useful, it does quite poorly in cases where the solution is changing rapidly - or we might need to make some smaller step sizes.  How we remedy this is to use a *variable step-solver*.  If you take a course in numerical analysis you might study these, but for the moment we have this implemented in the `MAT369Code` package, which by all intents and purposes is replacing `euler` with systems:

```{r,fig.width=4,fig.height=3}
deltaT <- .1    # timestep length
timeSteps <- 15   # must be a number greater than 1

parameters <- c(k=.05, beta=.2)   # parameters: a named vector

initialCondition <- c(S=300, I=1)  # Be sure you have enough conditions as you do variables.

dynamics <- function(t, state, parameters){
  with(as.list(c(state, parameters)), {  # Do not edit this line
    dS = -k*S*I  # <-- You may edit this line
    dI = k*S*I-beta*I # <-- You may edit this line.
    return(list(c(dS, dI)))  # <-- If you have more equations you will need to list the dVariables
  })
}


systems(deltaT,timeSteps,initialCondition,FUN=dynamics,parameters=parameters)
```

We still need to specify the stepsize $\Delta t$, as that is what gets returned and plotted for a solution.
