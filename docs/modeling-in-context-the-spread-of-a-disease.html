<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Modeling in context: the spread of a disease</h2>
<p>To see what the first steps would be, consider the data in Figure <a href="modeling-in-context-the-spread-of-a-disease.html#fig:sierra-leone">2.1</a>, which come from an <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/history/2014-2016-outbreak/index.html">Ebola outbreak</a> in Sierra Leone in 2014.</p>

<p class="caption">
Figure 2.1: An Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone
</p>
</div>
<p>These data represent the deaths due to Ebola in Sierra Leone. Constructing a model from disease dynamics is part of the field of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_modelling_of_infectious_disease">mathematical epidemiology</a>. How we construct a mathematical model of the spread of this outbreak largely depends on the assumptions underlying the dynamics of the disease, such as considering the rate of spread of Ebola. This model also depends on the spatial scale studied as well - how a model is constructed depends if we wish to examine the spread of the disease in an individual immune response, or understand general principles for the spread through a population.</p>
<p>Basic questions that one can ask is if the rate of deaths due to Ebola proportional to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of people infected?</li>
<li>The number of people not infected?</li>
<li>The number of infected people coming into contact with those not infected?</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s see what each of these mathematical models would look like if we wrote down an equation. Since we are discussing <em>rates</em> of infection, this means we will need a <em>rate of change</em> or derivative. Let’s use the letter <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> to represent the number of people that are infected.</p>
<div id="model-1-infection-rate-proportional-to-number-infected." class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> Model 1: Infection rate proportional to number infected.</h3>
<p>In the first case (the rate of infection proportional to the number of people infected), to translate that statement into an equation would be the following:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\frac{dI}{dt} = kI
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> can be thought of as a proportionality constant, with units of time<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span> for consistency. This is an example of a <em>differential equation</em>, which is just a mathematical equation with rates of change.</p>
<p>Differential equations may look different because what we are solving for is the function <span class="math inline">\(I(t)\)</span>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Later on we will examine how to ``solve’’ a differential equation (which means we determine the family of functions consistent with our rate equation).</p>
<p>Notice the proportionality constant <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> - we call this a <em>parameter</em>. We can always try to solve an equation without specifying the parameter - and then if we wanted to plot a solution the parameter would also be specified. In some situations we may not be as concerned with the particular <em>value</em> of the parameter but rather its influence on the long-term behavior of the system (this is one aspect of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifurcation_theory">bifurcation theory</a>). Otherwise we can use the collected data shown above with the given model to determine the value for <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. This combination of a mathematical model with data is called <em>data assimilation</em> or <em>model-data fusion</em>. How exciting!</p>
<p>Before we think about possible solutions let’s try to reason out if the first model would be plausible. This model states that the rate of change (the amount of increase) gets larger the more people that are sick. That does seem reasonable as a model, but perhaps unreasonable in real life. In the case of Ebola or any other infection disease, stringent public health measures would be put in place before large numbers of people die. We would expect that the rate of infection would decrease and the number of deaths to slow. So perhaps the second model might be a little more plausible. At some point the number of people who are <em>not</em> sick will reach zero, making the rate of infection be zero (or no increase).</p>
</div>
<div id="model-2-infection-rate-proportional-to-number-not-infected." class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.2</span> Model 2: Infection rate proportional to number NOT infected.</h3>
<p>In this description notice how we are talking about people who are sick (which we have denoted as <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>) and people who are <em>not</em> sick. This looks like we might need to introduce another variable for the ``not sick’’ people, which we will call <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, or susceptible. So the differential equation we would write down would be:</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:01notinfected">\[\begin{equation} 
\frac{dI}{dt} = kS  \tag{2.1}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>We are still using the parameter <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> as with the previous model. Also note we introduced the second variable <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is in Equation <a href="modeling-in-context-the-spread-of-a-disease.html#eq:01notinfected">(2.1)</a>. Because we have introduced another variable <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> we should also include a differential equation for how <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> changes as well. One way that we can do this is by considering our entire population as consisting of two groups of people: <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>. Infection brings someone over from <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>, which we have in this diagram:</p>
<p><img src="series_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>There are three reasons why I like to use diagrams like these: (1) they help organize my thinking about a mathematical model (2) any assumed parameters are listed, and (3) they help me to see that rates can be conserved. In other words, if I enter into the box for <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>, then someone is leaving <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. In other words, <span class="math inline">\(\displaystyle \frac{dS}{dt} = -kS\)</span>. So the two equations together can be represented as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
\frac{dS}{dt} &amp;= -kS \\
\frac{dI}{dt} &amp;= kS
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>This differential equation is what we would call a <em>coupled differential equation</em>. In order to ``solve’’ the system we need to determine functions for <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>. This coupled set of equations looks a little clunky, but we do notice something cool. Algebriacally we have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation} 
\frac{dS}{dt} +  \frac{dI}{dt} = \frac{d(S+I)}{dt} = 0
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>Recall from calculus that if a rate of change equals zero then the function is constant. In this case, the variable <span class="math inline">\(S+I\)</span> is constant, or we can also call <span class="math inline">\(S+I=N\)</span>, the number of people in the population. This means that <span class="math inline">\(S=N-I\)</span>, so we can re-write our differential equation in one equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\frac{dI}{dt} = k(N-I)
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>This second model does have some limiting behavior to this model as well. As the number of infected people reaches <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> (the total population size), the values of <span class="math inline">\(\displaystyle \frac{dI}{dt}\)</span> approaches zero, meaning <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> doesn’t change. There is one caveat to this - if there are no infected people around (<span class="math inline">\(I=0\)</span>) <em>the disease can still be transmitted</em>, which might make not good biological sense.</p>
</div>
<div id="model-3-infection-rate-proportional-to-infected-meeting-not-infected." class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.3</span> Model 3: Infection rate proportional to infected meeting not infected.</h3>
<p>The third model rectifies some of the shortcomings of the second model (which rectified the shortcomings of the first model). This model states that the rate of infection is due to those who are sick, actually infecting those who are not sick. This would sort of scenario would also make some sense, as it focused on that <em>transmission</em> of the disease are between susceptibles and infected people. So if nobody is sick (<span class="math inline">\(I=0\)</span>) then the disease is not spread. Likewise if there are no susceptibles (<span class="math inline">\(S=0\)</span>), the disease is not spread as well.</p>
<p>In this case the diagram outlining this approach looks something like this:</p>
<p><img src="series_files/figure-html/logistic-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The differential equations that describe this scenario are the following:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
\frac{dS}{dt} &amp;= -kSI \\
\frac{dI}{dt} &amp;= kSI
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>Just like before for Model 2 we can combine the two equations to yield a single differential equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\frac{dI}{dt} = k\cdot I \cdot (N-I)
\end{equation}\]</span>
Look’s pretty similar to model 2, doesn’t it? In this case notice the variable <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> outside the expression. Notice this seems to be appropriate - if <span class="math inline">\(I=0\)</span>, then there is no increase in infection. If <span class="math inline">\(I=N\)</span> (the total population size) then there is no increase in the infection.</p>
